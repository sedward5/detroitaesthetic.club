Specializing in vegetarian and vegan fare, and tucked away in the westgate shopping center, you may not have heard of it, especially if you&#8217;re a carnivore. Which I am. That said, their kitchen does amazing things with the food they create and their appetizers menu could be your whole meal. Seva also has a full bar, and a menu of 10-12 cocktails that changes fairly regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite cocktails, and one I often <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sedward5.com\/the-manhattan-my-way-a-toast-to-tradition\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.sedward5.com\/the-manhattan-my-way-a-toast-to-tradition\/\">make at home<\/a>. This 19th century cocktail from the New York club that shares its name, is a platform for experimentation. While it&#8217;s recipe seems simple at the surface, small tweaks can make it a dramatically different drink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Manhattan<\/p><cite>Bulleit bourbon and Carpano Antica vermouth stirred with Angostura bitters, on ice, with a Luxardo cherry  14<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This drink is close to the one I make at home. Carpano Antica absolutely brings this drink together. It&#8217;s subtle vanilla notes take the drink in a slightly sweeter, and less bitter Manhattan than you might otherwise experience. Bulleit bourbon is a fantastic base spirit to build this on. This all comes together with a large ice cube in a no-nonsense rocks glass and a Luxardo cherry, which flavors the drink with its syrup, even if you choose not to eat the garnish itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"968\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-968x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-61\" srcset=\"http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-968x1024.jpeg 968w, http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-284x300.jpeg 284w, http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-768x812.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-1452x1536.jpeg 1452w, http:\/\/192.168.1.95\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/IMG_0093-1936x2048.jpeg 1936w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This drink hits the stop that I want a manhattan to hit. Boozy, slightly sweet, complex, and timeless. At first look fourteen dollars seems like a bit high for this drink, but held alongside Manhattans from Sava&#8217;s, Raven Club, The Last Word, and The Gandy Dancer, this price seems to be the going rate, and the Manhattan at Seva&#8217;s definitely holds its own amongst the contenders from those better know cocktail establishments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time you&#8217;re looking for a quality cocktail on the west side, or if you&#8217;re taking a vegan friend out for drinks you should absolutely stop by Seva&#8217;s.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seva is a lesser known restaurant on the west side of Ann Arbor.
